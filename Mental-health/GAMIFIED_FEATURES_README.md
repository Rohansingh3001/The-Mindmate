   - Verify React Router setup

2. **Data not persisting**
   - Check localStorage permissions
   - Verify data structure matches expected format
   - Clear localStorage if migration needed

3. **Animation performance**
   - Reduce animation complexity on older devices
   - Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
   - Optimize re-renders with React.memo

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Lazy load components
const GamifiedJournal = React.lazy(() => import('../components/GamifiedJournal'));

// Memoize expensive calculations
const userStats = useMemo(() => calculateUserStats(), [userData]);

// Debounce frequent updates
const debouncedSave = useCallback(debounce(saveData, 500), []);
```
